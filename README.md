A company (e.g., AWS) provides an online storage management facility (like OneDrive) where
computer users may store their files. Suppose that such a facility provides the following two
services:
1) Selection of a package from a customer based on the existing storage containers provided
by the company
2) Monthly fee calculation based on the size (in Gigabytes) of the online space occupied on
the companyâ€™s cloud

The web application must provide RESTful web services for the above. The RESTful web services
must use the JAX-RS/Jersey Annotations and must accept the input data as path parameter format.
